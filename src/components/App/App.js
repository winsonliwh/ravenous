            New more branch - Agent Concept
              Added AgentPages
                This is a checkout a new function b and this will replace function a based on AgentPages.
                Work on function b.0.0.1 but we found that function a is better solution.
                  Good idea on this story as function b.0.0.2
                    Updated function b.0.0.2.1
                New more branch - Agent Function a
                  New completed pages for Agent Function a
                    After built function b, we found that Function a is a better solution but we need to upgrade function a to a.0.0.1
                    Writing function a.0.0.1 to a.0.0.2
                    Checked a.0.0.2 is perfect
                    Pls consider to use a.0.0.2 instead of function b.
                    Confirmed by Dev Manager
                      later, a.0.0.2.1 is passed the QA test after a small changes
                        We found that b.0.0.2.2. Added that in a.0.0.2.2
                          Furthermore, a.0.0.2.2 has more things to add
                            Add files(xyz) in a.0.0.2.2
                              Since a.0.0.2.2 absorbed function b.0.0.2.1, pls do clear up for b.0.0.2.1
                                New Status 2: clear up of b.0.0.2.2 completed. Here is a.0.0.2.3 (just clear up and no need to release)
